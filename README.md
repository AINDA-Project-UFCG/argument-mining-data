# AINDA Project - Argument Mining (AM)
Hello!
This repository contains a branch of the AINDA project focused on developing solutions for Argument Mining (AM).

In this repository, you will find the available data from debates for AM, as well as code snippets demonstrating how to process and utilize this data.

The data and code provided are the results of a masterâ€™s degree research project, which is fully accessible [here](https://example.com/research-document).

### About the Data
To construct this dataset, a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between Argument Mining and education was essential. For this purpose, a survey ([A Comprehensive Survey of Argument Mining in the Educational Domain: Techniques, Applications, and Future Directions](https://example.com/research-document)) was made. Additionally, a customized annotation protocol was developed, as AM presents unique challenges for NLP due to the lack of a universally accepted framework for data annotation. The research ([An In Depth Data Annotation Protocol for Argument Mining in Semi Structured Debates](https://example.com/research-document)) and the [protocol](available) are available in the links. 

The data was manually annotated using an annotation tool developed by the LACINA lab at UFCG. For more details on the annotation process, refer to the annotation protocol in the provided PDF.

### Open Source and Research Use
This dataset is open-source and can be freely used for research purposes.

Enjoy! ;)
