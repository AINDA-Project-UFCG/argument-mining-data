# AINDA Project - Argument Mining (AM)
Hello!
This repository contains a branch of the AINDA project focused on developing solutions for Argument Mining (AM).

In this repository, you will find the available data from debates for AM, as well as code snippets demonstrating how to process and utilize this data.

The data and code provided are the results of a masterâ€™s degree research project, which is fully accessible here.

### About the Data
To construct this dataset, a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between Argument Mining and education was essential. For this purpose, a survey was made, which you can access here. Additionally, a customized annotation protocol was developed, as AM presents unique challenges for NLP due to the lack of a universally accepted framework for data annotation. The research (here) and the protocol () are avilbale in the links. 

The data was manually annotated using an annotation tool developed by the LACINA lab at UFCG. For more details on the annotation process, refer to the annotation protocol in the provided PDF.

### Open Source and Research Use
This dataset is open-source and can be freely used for research purposes.

Enjoy! ;)
