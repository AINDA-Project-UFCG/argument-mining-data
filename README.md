# AINDA Project - DEBISS-Arg - Argument Mining  

Hello!  
This repository contains a branch of the AINDA project focused on developing solutions for Argument Mining (AM).  

In this repository, you will find data from debates with various AM data annotations.  

The data provided are the results of a masterâ€™s degree research project, which is fully accessible [here](https://example.com/research-document).  

## About the Data  

To construct this dataset, a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between Argument Mining and education was essential. For this purpose, a  
[survey](https://example.com/research-document) was conducted. 

Additionally, a customized annotation protocol was developed, as AM presents unique challenges for NLP due to the lack of a universally accepted framework for data annotation. The protocol can be found in the PDF file titled **"Annotation Protocol"** ([available here](https://github.com/AINDA-Project-UFCG/argument-mining-data/blob/main/protocol.pdf)).  

To increase awareness of this dataset within the scientific community and discuss its contributions in detail, the following research was developed and published:  
[DEBISS-Arg Corpus](https://example.com/research-document).  

The data was manually annotated using an annotation tool developed by the LACINA lab at UFCG. For more details on the annotation and review process, refer to the annotation protocol in the provided PDF, as well as the research conducted for the corpus.  

## Open Source and Research Use  

This dataset is open-source and can be freely used for research purposes.  

Enjoy! ðŸ˜‰
